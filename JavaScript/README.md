Between 2000 and 2002, I wrote a few scripts in unstandardized JavaScript as a hobby. **All the descriptions and comments are in Dutch.** These are standalone scripts that weren't integrated into the rest of my website.

* **kleurenkiezer.html** is a simple color picker for 'websafe' colors that displays an HTML color code when you click on the color.
* **spinscript.html** allows anyone to generate a web page with simple design elements like headers, images, links and background images or background colors. It was clumsy and required a lot of explanation, but at the time it was magic to let my 7 and 15 year old nephews make their own webpages.
* **top10.html** is a countdown script which shows, as an example, a list of 10 terrible Christmas presents, which I compiled from various Internet sources. I also made a much funnier version about 'Reassuring sayings from project managers', which I won't post here since it was about my job.
* **versifex.html** is a poetry generator that focuses on testing rhyming schemes. It's meant as a tool for poets. It would actually be easier to generate realistic poetry from a word corpus. This one generates nonsense words from scratch that sound like Dutch - but a bit more emphatic. I used Versifex to fill up my [Steem blog](https://steemit.com/@edb) with nonsense. I might update this one. TODO 1: add more than 4 different rhymes. TODO 2: generalize it a little, so that it could be used for English or German too.

Here's an example of a Versifex poem:

van en al rat waunen benondaar zolroopla  
gas erg zam moomon bikgebeet ninman  
hijeen es jop voechik derverglaas slekdedin

kim zij nok beenin nirgezoon domzuip

blet uit slat sleetep watberaam repsbledin

oper ik pran goonem noffaat sliksloopla
